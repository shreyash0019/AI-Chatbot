# AI Chatbot

## Introduction
An AI chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, or interactive agent) is a computer program or artificial intelligence designed to conduct conversations with users via auditory or textual methods. This project demonstrates the creation of a simple AI chatbot using the `aiml` library in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `aiml` library

## How to Run the Chatbot
Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot:

1. **Install the required library**:
   First, ensure that the `aiml` library is installed. You can install it using the command:

   ```bash
   pip install aiml
   ```

2. **Run the chatbot**:
   After installing the required libraries, you can run the chatbot by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python bash.py
   ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Once the script is running, you will be prompted to type a message.
   - The chatbot will respond based on the loaded AIML files.
   - You can type your message in the terminal, and the chatbot will process it and provide a response.

4. **AIML Files**:
   The chatbot uses AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) files to define patterns and responses. Ensure the `load.xml` file is present and contains the necessary patterns and responses for the chatbot to work.

## Notes
- The script attempts to install the `aiml` module automatically if it's not already installed.
- If you encounter issues with internet connectivity, please ensure you have a stable internet connection for the installation process.
- To exit the program, simply close the terminal or press `Ctrl+C`.
